# epidemic-simulator

Simulates an epidemic by modeling people as colored dots moving around in a box. The dots are color coded by status (currently infected, not infected, recovered, dead). An infected dot infects another dot if it touches it. The user can control various rates, such as infection rate, death rate, and social distancing rate. The simulator also display a graph that shows the number of infections over time.
